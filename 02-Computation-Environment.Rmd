If you using lots of different bioinformatics tools at some point of time must have downloaded a tool, complied (if not already in binary) and then exported path.

```bash
export PATH="tool-path:$PATH"
```

Or if you are lucky, then downloaded using some system package manager, which automatically exports the path for you.

```bash
apt-get install fastqc
```

Basically you have told the computer to make available the tool in you **current environment**. So that you can just call the tool name instead of giving the whole path every time.

But maintaining **this environments** becomes very difficult when you working with lots of tools or in a shared computer(HPC) and Cloud.

And what if tomorrow if you wants to change your system or you tell you collaborator to run the whole thing what you have run. Then in both the case all the tools need to be installed again from scratch.

In that case following tools/platforms comes handy 

In that case following tools/platforms comes handy 

* [Conda](#a-basic-conda-guide) - An open-source package manager and environment management system.
* [Docker](#a-basic-docker-guide) - A light weight platform which helps create portable virtual environment.

## A basic conda guide

Conda is a package manager and environment management system. That means you can install any tool using this and at the same time you can use this to manager those tools in different environments.

I work with quite a lot of tools and packages. Personally conda have been a life saver for me. Which you will also realize as soon as you start using it yourself.

Tools/Packages in conda are distributed in different channels. [Read more about conda channels here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/channels.html)

Most of the tools used by Bioinformatics applications are available in **bioconda** channel. So If you looking for a tool just google it followed by bioconda, and in most cases the first or second link will take to its conda home page. There you will get information about how to install it. Also, you can search for the tool from command line as well.

Example:

```bash
conda search -c bioconda tool_name
```

So for say if you just wants to install `fastqc` then a simple google will land you at [this fastqc conda home page](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/fastqc)

Or from command line - 

```bash
conda search fastqc -c bioconda

fastqc                        0.11.7      pl5.22.0_0  bioconda            
fastqc                        0.11.7      pl5.22.0_2  bioconda            
fastqc                        0.11.8               2  bioconda            
fastqc                        0.11.9               0  bioconda    
```

Here, the output shows different version. If you want you can mention a particular version while installing (such as `fastqc=0.11.9`) otherwise conda itself coice a particular lastest version based on suitable dependency.

lets install fastp

```bash
conda search fastqc -c bioconda
```

this may take few minutes depedning upon the number of dependency

## A basic docker guide

Docker is a tool which helps you create light weight **containers**, which are portable.

You can think a container as a Computer system where all you tools are installed and ready to use.

The logic to make a container can be write in a **Dockerfile**

An example Dockerfile

```docker
FROM ubuntu:19.10

RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y fastqc 
```

Built the docker image

```bash
cd docker
docker build -t fastqc:latest .
```

Run the docker container

```bash
docker run --rm fastqc:latest fastqc --help
```

You should see the `fastqc` help menu
