# CONTRIBUTING

First of all thank you for your interest in contributing to this project :)

## Project structure

We use Rmd files to write the contents, and [bookdown](http://bookdown.org/) R-package is being used to render the site.

Lets say you want to add a new chapter please follow these steps, which will help us maintain a structure - 

* Fork this repo 
* Create a new file with chapter number and the main heading.
* After you make changes, push the code raise a PR against `devel` branch.
