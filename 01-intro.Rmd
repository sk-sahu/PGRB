# Introduction

Reproducibility is very much essential for any kind of scientific research.

As Biology becoming more of computational and data driven, It is responsibility of the researcher to take advantage of available concepts/platforms/methods/tools to reproduce every piece of results/findings. 

With this training guide the intention is to familiarize you with those available concepts/platforms/methods/tools.

This is made keeping focus on the people from Biological background with good knowledge of bash scripting and programming.

By End of this training you will get an good idea of  

* Reproducing Computation Environment
* Reproducing a Analysis
* Reproducing a Workflow/Pipeline
